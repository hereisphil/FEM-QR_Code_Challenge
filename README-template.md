## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Honestly, what I learned the most is that I really need to study and practice more on centering and the use of flex box.

For example my solution contains:

```html
<body>
  <div class="wrapper">...</div>
</body>
```

and I'm uncertain if wrapping the entire page within a <div> element just apply the following CSS:

```
/* Center Content */
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 90vh;
}
```

is considered modern best practices. I'd love feedback on this. Secondly, I didn't apply any media queries for responsiveness because I found the site to be quite responsive already. Perhaps I didn't do enough testing? Please let me know.

Overall though, I am proud of my solution, especially with the fact that I didn't use ChatGPT at all ðŸ˜† I did have to play around a bit with the CSS and I only had to look up box-shadow properties.

### Continued development

FOCUS ON: CSS + Flex Box

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools Box Shadow](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp) - I used this to remind me that the properties are: horizontal, vertical, blur, spread, color.
